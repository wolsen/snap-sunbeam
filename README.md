## The smallest, simplest OpenStack

Pure upstream, lightweight OpenStack in a single package that makes OpenStack
simple to setup, manage and maintain.

Perfect for:
* Developer workstations
* Edge
* Small-scale private cloud deployments
* CI/CD

## Why MicroStack?

* **Small.** Developers want the smallest and simplest stable OpenStack for
  laptop and workstation development. 
* **Simple.** Minimize administration and operations with a single-package install
  that has no moving parts for simplicity and certainty. All dependencies and batteries
  included.
* **Compact.** MicroStack comes with minimal footprint which makes it ideal for
  devices with limited hardware resources.
* **Comprehensive** - MicroStack contains core OpenStack services and world class
  virtualisation software for your cloud needs:
  * Keystone
  * Horizon
  * Glance
  * Nova (KVM)
  * Neutron (OVN)

For more information, check the [MicroStack documentation][microstack-docs].

## Quickstart

MicroStack is going in a whole new direction - in a good way! We've listened to feedback from users and there is a general desire to go from a single-node trial run on a developer workstatation / solitary server and grow that installation into a production-grade OpenStack.

## Quickstart (Sunbeam)

Install pre-requisites:

```bash
sudo snap install microk8s --channel 1.25-strict/stable
sudo microk8s enable dns hostpath-storage
sudo microk8s enable metallb 10.20.20.1/29
sudo snap install juju --channel 3.0/edge
```

Install MicroStack from the sunbeam channel:

```bash
sudo snap install microstack --devmode --channel sunbeam/beta
```

Connect Microstack to Juju:

```bash
sudo snap connect microstack:juju-bin juju:juju-bin
```

Bootstrap the cloud and configure the OpenStack services.

```bash
microstack bootstrap
```

## Quickstart (Beta)

Install MicroStack from the Beta channel. Note, this must be installed in devmode:

    sudo snap install microstack --devmode --beta

Initialise MicroStack for your environment. This will set up databases, networks,
security groups, flavors, and a CirrOS image for testing your installation:

    sudo microstack init --auto --control

Launch your first instance:

    microstack launch cirros --name test

SSH to your test instance. SSH Keys are setup as part of the initialisation step and
can be used to access the CirrOS instance just launched:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_microstack cirros@<ip-address>

# Requirements

A system running MicroStack should have the following minimum requirements:

* multi-core CPU
* 8 GiB of RAM
* 100 GiB of Disk space

## OpenStack client

The OpenStack client can be installed by running `sudo snap install openstackclients`.
Once installed, you will be able to use the openstack client as normal:

    openstack network list
    openstack flavor list
    openstack keypair list
    openstack image list
    openstack security group rule list

## Accessing Horizon

To create an instance (called "awesome") based on the CirrOS image:

    microstack.launch cirros --name awesome

## SSH to an instance

The launch output will show you how to connect to the instance. For the CirrOS
image, the user account is 'cirros'.

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_microstack cirros@<ip-address>

## Horizon

The launch output will also provide information for the Horizon dashboard. The
username is 'admin' and the password can be obtained in this way:

    sudo snap get microstack config.credentials.keystone-password
